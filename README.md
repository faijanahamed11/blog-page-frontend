## 📖 Project Overview

**LU BLOGS** is a comprehensive social blogging platform designed specifically for university communities. Think of it as a Reddit-style platform where students can share posts, engage in discussions, vote on content, and interact in real-time. The platform features a sophisticated ranking algorithm, private messaging, admin tools, and a reward system to encourage active participation.

### Why This Project?

This project demonstrates my ability to build a production-ready, full-stack web application with:
- **Complex algorithms** (Reddit-style hot score ranking)
- **Real-time features** (live chat, notifications, typing indicators)
- **Scalable architecture** (optimized database queries, connection pooling)
- **Security best practices** (rate limiting, authentication, input validation)
- **Modern UI/UX** (responsive design, dark mode, smooth animations)

## 📊 Architecture & Design Decisions

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL** (Supabase) for relational data with JSONB for flexible schemas
- Optimized indexes on frequently queried fields (hot_score, created_at)
- Connection pooling for efficient resource management
- Row-level security policies for data protection

### Real-time Communication
- **Socket.IO** for bidirectional communication
- Room-based messaging for private conversations
- Connection deduplication to prevent memory leaks
- Throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse

### Ranking Algorithm
- **Reddit Hot Score Formula**: `log10(score) + (seconds - epoch) / 45000`
- Logarithmic scaling prevents score inflation
- Time decay ensures recent content stays relevant
- Wilson Score for statistical confidence

### Performance Optimizations
- Batch database queries to reduce round trips
- Pagination for large datasets
- Image compression and lazy loading
- Code splitting and tree shaking
- CDN for static assets
